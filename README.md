# Word-Guess-Game

This is a hangman-style word-guess game that uses keycodes from button presses to check if the word to guess contains the pressed key. Written in vanilla javascript, this application demonstrates a basic understanding of the manipulation of arrays and keystroke events. 

## Deployment

Deployed on githib pages at https://matthias61984.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/.

## To Play

Start the game by making a keystroke to guess your first letter. Letters will show up in the word if correct, or in the "wrong guesses" area if incorrect. Users will recieve a sassy response from Ramsay if you choose the same letter twice, so pay attention to what you're doing!

If you are successful before running out of guesses, you will win Ramsay's sarcastic approval. Fail, however, and he has something else to say... In both win and lose scenarios, the game resets after incrementing a win or loss and you may continue playing.
